## HEI Review Questions

- Consistent with the original statement of work?
- Introduction provides adequate background to interpret the study and its
findings?
- Are the study design and methods appropriate?
- Do the results follow from the study design and methods and include appropriate
statistical analyses?
- Are the interpretation and conclusions adequately supported by the results? Are the caveats appropriately described?
- Do the raw data and their subsequent analyses require more in-depth evaluation?

- Present a combined total of 10 to 15 essential figures and summary tables.
- Additional figures, tables, and text in web-only Appendices
- Additional Materials (e.g.,computer code or raw data tables).

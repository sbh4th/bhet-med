Purpose of this document is to just work through the key ideas for mediation using an empirical example. We'll start with. 

Let's use the example data from the `mediator` package

```{r}
mm <- mediator::mediator(data = mediation_example,
                   out.model = glm(y ~ x + m_01 + c + x*m_01,
                                   family = "binomial",
                                   data = mediation_example),
                   med.model = glm(m_01 ~ x + c, 
                                   family = "binomial",
                                   data = mediation_example),
                   treat = "x")
